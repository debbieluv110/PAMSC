### 2.3 Target Variable Generation

The dropout risk indicator was generated using a realistic probability model:

```
P(dropout) = 0.3 × (GPA < 2.0) + 
             0.2 × (Attendance < 0.8) + 
             0.15 × (Income < $30K) + 
             0.1 × (Single Parent) + 
             0.1 × (Disciplinary > 3) + 
             0.05 × (Absences > 15) + 
             0.05 × (Homework < 0.6) + 
             0.05 × (Age > 17) + 
             Random Noise
```

This approach ensures realistic correlations between features and outcomes while maintaining statistical validity.
